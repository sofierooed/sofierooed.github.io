Sustainable Innovations Camp is a 3-day camp which will run 5 different editions per year, with 30 participants per camp. The camps are hosted at Universities all over Denmark. The main goal is to educate how to implement SDGs using a case-based learning approach, whereby students work together with leading companies on real sustainable business cases.

  <h3 id="reflecting-on-assignment-2">Reflecting on Assignment 2</h3>
<h6 id="a-brief-introduction-to-the-assignment">A brief introduction to the assignment</h6>
<p>The assignment 2 can be found here: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html. In this assignment, I was supposed to build on my previous webshop to further create a login and registration page for the user. When the user has selected desired quantity, the user should be redirected to the login page. If the user alreade has registered a user, the customer needs to log in in order to get the invoice. However, if the customer do not have a user, it will be ridirected to the register page to register with a valid email, name and password. When the user is created, the customer will need to log in to get the invoice.</p>

<h6 id="what-did-you-learn-from-this-assignment">What did you learn from this assignment?</h6>
<p>From this assignment, I gained experience in implementing user authentication and registration systems, understanding how to securely store and manage user data. I also learned to about user data persistence, and how it involves storing and retrieving information from files. Further, I gained experience in achieving a personalized user experience by displaying user-specific information, such as greetings and personalized invoices.</p>

<h6 id="did-you-work-with-a-partner">Did you work with a partner?</h6>
<p>I worked alone.</p>

<h6 id="how-did-you-get-help-when-you-needed-it-what-did-you-need-help-with">How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h6>
<p>I had some trouble getting the input in the forms sticky. I solved this by RTFMing a lot by searching online, and look at our previous work from class.</p>

<h6 id="how-was-developing-this-assignment-different-than-assignment-1">How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h6>
<p>I believe it in some ways was harder than assignment 1 as we had more freedom for how to solve the task, as the instructions was not as clear as they was for assignment 1. I also found it hard sometimes to build on top of the previous code from assignment 1 as I had used some logic which needed to be changed in order to fulfill the criterions for assignment 2.</p>

<h6 id="estimate-the--of-time-you-spent-a-thinking-about-how-to-do-something-b-writing-code-but-do-not-include-testing-c-testing-and-debugging">Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h6>
<p>I believe I spent about 25% thinking about how I was going to do something, 15% on writing the code, and 60% on testing and debugging.</p>

<h6 id="describe-what-worked-well-with-this-project-what-did-not-work-well">Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h6>
<p>What worked well was to implement the code we did in class into the assignment. Clearly use cases also helped guide the development process. They set expectations and provide a roadmap for implementing features. I had a lot of trouble with getting data from one page to another, which is what I also spendt the most time on figuring out how to solve. I also sometimes struggled with figuring out exactly what was required to do, as the instructions were some what more vague than for assignment 1.</p>

<h6 id="if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-do-things-differently-what-would-you-do-differently">If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h6>
<p>When I started working on assignment 2, I just copied a lot of code from the lab and examples into the code I was using. However, I figured out that it was a bad way to do it as it was not quite fit for my specific code. Hence, I had to start all over and figure out how to implement it for my specific usecase. If I could start over, I would have done this from the beginning.</p>
